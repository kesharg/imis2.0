#  Water Supply ISS

The Water Supply Information Support System sub-module maintains information on Water Supply Bill Payment data.

## Workflow

Water supply payment data is imported into watersupply_payments table via CSV file. The file is stored in the server in storage disk path as defined in config\\filesystems.php for 'importwatersupply'.

Consecutively, triggers are run which creates materialized view with few steps of operations including create status table, update tax building owner information and updates proportion column in tables ‘wards’ and ‘grids’.

The table watersupply_payment_status is created with calculated due_years based on last_payment_date (default value:99) and Match value based on the presence of bin in the system. For buildings with match watersupply_payment_id, owner_name, owner_gender, owner_contact are updated and if data is for new bin, then new data is created in building_info.owners table.
