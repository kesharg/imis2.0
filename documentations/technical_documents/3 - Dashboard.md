# Dashboard

The dashboard utilizes the following tools to deliver data and insights:

-   Charts: Created with Chart.js for visual representation of data.
-   Cards: Built with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. These cards can house both count boxes and charts.
-   Icons: SVG and Font Awesome.

## Data Retrieval

-   Controller: The HomeController (located at app\\Http\\Controllers\\HomeController.php) initiates data fetching. Clear code comments within the controller aid in understanding this process.

Charts

-   Data Fetching: Raw SQL queries are used to fetch data for charts.
-   Service Class: A dedicated service class (located at app\\Services\\DashboardService.php) houses the logic for these raw queries.

Count Boxes

-   Data Fetching: Laravel Eloquent retrieves data for count boxes.
-   Filtering: Specific count boxes offer year-based filtering. Simply select a year to focus on a particular timeframe and narrow down the displayed data for a more focused analysis.
-   Year-Based Filtering Logic: When you submit a year (e.g., "2024"), the HomeController utilizes an if-else statement to determine the appropriate data to display. This ensures you see either a specific chart for the requested year or a general chart encompassing all data.
